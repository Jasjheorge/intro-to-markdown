<!-- STRIKE THROUGH-->

This is an example of a ~~strikethroug~~- text, anything in between in double tilde opening characters and closing double tilde characters will be displayed as a ~~strikethrough~~ text

We can add triple hypens to be able to create a horizontal rule for separating content.

Another way to add  __HORIZONTAL RULES__ in our document markdown is by using 3 underscores.

<!--ESCAPE CHARACTER RULE USING BACKSLASH-->

This is an example of a *text with an asterisk*. When we don't want it to be italicized. We want to use the backslash \ to escape the rule of using an opening \*asterisk* and closing \*asterisk* to enclose the text content.
